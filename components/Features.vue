            And that is freakin’ awesome – and so needed right now. None of us
            expected to become remote employees for so long. The truth is, your
            team misses seeing and laughing with their coworkers (even if they
            did get to relocate to a cheaper city).

            Now at this point, you’ve probably done the “obvious” virtual team
            events: the online escape room, the virtual happy hour, the remote
            trivia night. (No shade — these are all great too, but most teams
            have been there, done that.)

            Look, there’s no shortage of out-of-work entertainers who could jump
            onto Zoom and juggle in front of your team. But does that really
            make your team feel any closer? Eh…not really.

            What we’ve designed are experiences that emphasize team bonding –
            but not in a cheesy way. Like a hands-on graffiti workshop led by a
            world-class street artist, where you’ll get to show off your drawing
            skills and encourage your teammates.

            Or a stand-up comedy show, where everyone gets involved. Or a
            competitive pub quiz with the most hilarious host in London. Or
            high-energy karaoke with a serious diva as your MC. You get the
            idea. These are experiences focused on your team — with time to
            talk, perform, and hang out.
